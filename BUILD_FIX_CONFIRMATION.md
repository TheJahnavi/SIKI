# SIKI Build Verification Complete

## ✅ Build Issue Resolved

The ES module compatibility issue that was causing Netlify build failures has been successfully resolved.

### Changes Made:
1. **Renamed build script**: `scripts/build.js` → `scripts/build.cjs`
2. **Updated package.json**: Build script now correctly references `scripts/build.cjs`
3. **Verified functionality**: Build process completes successfully locally

### Verification Results:
- ✅ `npm run build` executes without errors
- ✅ Dist directory is created with all necessary files
- ✅ All assets are properly copied and optimized
- ✅ ES module compatibility is maintained

### Next Steps:
1. Netlify should now be able to build the site successfully
2. The frontend will be deployed to https://scanitknowit.netlify.app/
3. Backend deployment to Render can proceed with the same fix applied

### Technical Details:
The issue was caused by the project being configured to use ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json) while the build scripts were using CommonJS syntax. Renaming the scripts to use the `.cjs` extension resolves this compatibility issue.

This same fix has already been applied to:
- `server.js` → `server.cjs`
- `build.js` → `build.cjs`
- `jest.config.js` → `jest.config.cjs`

The build should now work correctly on all platforms including Netlify.
