# Next Steps for Getting Contextual AI Answers

This document outlines the exact steps you need to take to get contextual AI answers from the SIKI application's chatbot.

## Current Status

The SIKI application is fully implemented with all requested AI/ML integrations:
- OCR with Tesseract.js
- Computer Vision with TensorFlow.js and MobileNet
- Contextual Chat with Hugging Face Llama-2
- Database integration with Google Cloud Firestore

However, to get actual contextual AI answers (rather than simulated responses), you need to complete two key configuration steps.

## Step 1: Configure the Hugging Face API Key

### Current Status
The application is correctly reporting an error because the `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env` file is either missing or incorrect.

### Required Action
You must obtain a real Inference API Key from Hugging Face and replace the placeholder in your `.env` file.

### Detailed Instructions

1. **Create a Hugging Face Account**
   - Go to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
   - Click "Sign up" to create a new account or "Sign in" if you already have one

2. **Get Your API Token**
   - After logging in, click on your profile picture in the top right corner
   - Select "Settings"
   - Go to the "Access Tokens" section
   - Click "New token"
   - Give your token a name (e.g., "SIKI App")
   - Select the role (typically "Read" is sufficient for inference)
   - Click "Create token"
   - Copy the generated token

3. **Update the .env File**
   - Open the `.env` file in your project root
   - Replace `YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` with your actual API token:
     ```env
     HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_actual_huggingface_api_key_here
     ```

## Step 2: Configure Firebase for Product Data Storage

### Current Status
Your chatbot is designed to be context-aware, meaning it needs to pull the product information from Firestore before asking the AI a question about it. Currently, Firebase initialization is failing because the service account file is not properly configured.

### Required Action
You need to replace the contents of `firebase-service-account.json` with your real Firebase Service Account JSON and ensure the product analysis data exists in Firestore.

### Detailed Instructions

1. **Create a Firebase Project**
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Click "Create a project" or select an existing project
   - Follow the setup wizard to create your project

2. **Enable Firestore**
   - In the Firebase Console, select your project
   - Click "Firestore Database" in the left navigation
   - Click "Create database"
   - Choose "Start in test mode" (for development) or "Start in locked mode" (for production)
   - Select a location and click "Enable"

3. **Create a Service Account**
   - In the Firebase Console, click the gear icon next to "Project Overview" and select "Project settings"
   - Go to the "Service accounts" tab
   - Click "Generate new private key"
   - Save the JSON file as `firebase-service-account.json` in your project root directory

4. **Replace Placeholder Content**
   - Open the `firebase-service-account.json` file
   - Replace all placeholder content with your actual service account credentials

## Step 3: Test the Complete Workflow

### Process Overview
1. Ensure Firebase is configured correctly and connected to Firestore
2. Run the `/api/analyze-product` endpoint to analyze a product image
3. Check Firestore to confirm a document was created with the productId
4. Run the `/api/chat` endpoint with the productId to get contextual answers

### Detailed Testing Steps

1. **Analyze a Product**
   - Use the following curl command to test the analyze endpoint:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/analyze-product \
       -F "image=@docs/test-product-label.txt"
     ```
   - Note the `productId` returned in the response

2. **Verify Firestore Data**
   - Go to the Firebase Console
   - Navigate to your Firestore database
   - Check the `productAnalysis` collection for the new document

3. **Chat with Context**
   - Use the productId from step 1 to ask a contextual question:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"productId": "img_1234567890", "query": "Is this product healthy?"}'
     ```

## Expected Results

### Before Configuration
- Chat responses will be simulated generic messages
- Error messages about missing API keys or Firebase configuration

### After Configuration
- Chat responses will be specific to the product data
- Context-aware answers based on ingredients, nutrition, and allergens
- Proper storage and retrieval of analysis data in Firestore
- Real integration with Hugging Face Llama-2 model

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid Hugging Face API Key**
   - Ensure you've copied the full token without extra spaces
   - Verify the token has the correct permissions
   - Check that you're using an Inference API token, not a general access token

2. **Firebase Authentication Errors**
   - Ensure the service account JSON file is properly formatted
   - Verify all fields in the JSON file are correctly populated
   - Check that the service account has Firestore access

3. **Network Issues**
   - Ensure your firewall allows outbound connections to Hugging Face
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify Hugging Face services are operational

### Logging and Debugging

The application provides detailed logging:
- API key validation status
- Firebase connection attempts
- OCR and computer vision processing steps
- Hugging Face API call details
- Database operations

Check the server console output for detailed information about each step of the process.

## Conclusion

Once you complete these two configuration steps:
1. Add your real Hugging Face API key to the `.env` file
2. Configure your Firebase service account properly

The SIKI application will provide true contextual AI answers based on actual product analysis data, rather than simulated responses. The application is fully implemented and ready to provide sophisticated product analysis with AI-powered insights.
