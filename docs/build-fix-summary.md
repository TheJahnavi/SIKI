# Build Fix Summary

## Issue
The Netlify build was failing with the following error:
```
ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope, you can use import instead
This file is being treated as an ES module because it has a '.js' file extension and '/opt/build/repo/package.json' contains "type": "module". To treat it as a CommonJS script, rename it to use the '.cjs' file extension.
```

## Root Cause
The project was configured to use ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json), but the build scripts were using CommonJS syntax (`require()` statements). This created a compatibility issue when running the build on Netlify.

## Solution
1. **Renamed build script**: Changed `scripts/build.js` to `scripts/build.cjs` to make it a CommonJS file
2. **Updated package.json**: Changed the build script command from `node scripts/build.js` to `node scripts/build.cjs`
3. **Committed and pushed changes**: Ensured all changes were pushed to the repository

## Files Modified
- `scripts/build.js` → `scripts/build.cjs` (renamed)
- `package.json` (updated build script reference)

## Verification
The build process now works correctly:
- ✅ ES module compatibility resolved
- ✅ Build script executes without errors
- ✅ Dist directory is created with all necessary files
- ✅ All assets are properly copied and optimized

## Deployment
After pushing these changes, Netlify should be able to build the site successfully. The build process will:
1. Run `npm run build` (which now correctly calls `node scripts/build.cjs`)
2. Create the `dist` directory with all compiled assets
3. Deploy the static files for the frontend

## Additional Notes
This fix also applies to other server-side scripts in the project:
- `server.js` was renamed to `server.cjs` for the same reason
- All CommonJS scripts should use the `.cjs` extension when the project uses ES modules
