# SPA Routing Fix

## Issue
The SIKI application was experiencing issues when refreshing pages or navigating directly to URLs. This is a common problem with Single Page Applications (SPAs) deployed to static hosting services like Netlify.

## Root Causes
1. **No client-side routing**: The application used simple show/hide logic but didn't implement proper client-side routing
2. **Browser navigation not handled**: Back/forward buttons and direct URL access weren't properly managed
3. **Server routing conflicts**: When refreshing `/result`, the server tried to find that file which doesn't exist
4. **Missing hash-based routing**: SPAs typically use hash-based routing (#) for client-side navigation

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Client-Side Routing
- Implemented hash-based routing using `window.location.hash`
- Added navigation functions that update the URL hash when switching pages
- Added initial routing handler that checks the URL hash on page load

### 2. Browser Navigation Handling
- Added event listener for `popstate` event to handle browser back/forward buttons
- Implemented proper state management for navigation history

### 3. Direct URL Access
- Added logic to handle direct access to URLs
- Redirects to home page when accessing result page directly without state

### 4. API Configuration Updates
- Updated placeholder URLs in config.js to be more realistic
- Maintained environment-specific configurations

## Files Modified

### scripts/main.js
- Added `handleInitialRouting()` function to check URL hash on load
- Added `handleBrowserNavigation()` function for popstate events
- Modified `navigateToResultPage()` and `navigateToHomePage()` to update URL hash
- Added event listener for browser navigation

### index.html
- Added script to handle routing before main app loads
- Ensures proper handling of direct URL access

### scripts/config.js
- Updated placeholder URLs to be more realistic
- Maintained proper environment configuration structure

## How It Works

### Navigation
1. When navigating to the result page: `window.location.hash = '#/result'`
2. When navigating to home page: `window.location.hash = ''`
3. On page load, `handleInitialRouting()` checks the hash and shows the appropriate page

### Browser Navigation
1. Browser back/forward buttons trigger `popstate` event
2. `handleBrowserNavigation()` calls `handleInitialRouting()` to show the correct page

### Direct URL Access
1. If user accesses `/result` directly, the Netlify redirect rule sends them to `index.html`
2. The initial routing script checks if there's valid state to show the result page
3. If not, it redirects to the home page

## Testing
The fix has been tested locally and verified to work with:
- Page refreshes on both home and result pages
- Browser back/forward navigation
- Direct URL access
- SPA navigation between pages

## Deployment
After pushing these changes, Netlify should properly handle all routing scenarios, making the application fully functional even when users refresh pages or navigate directly to URLs.
